# Landing Page Project
The purpose of this project to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Files
-Index.html
-styles.css
-app.js
-readme.md

## Index.html
This file is mainly written by Udacity, and some elements were added by me to complete the project.

## Index
This file represents the skeleton of the landing page. Within the header, you'll find the navigation outlined. Within the body, there are four sections that are added to begin with. Right now, there is simply filler text here but this can be easily fixed in the future. Note the `id`, `class`, and `data-nav` variables and how they are used. This will come into play later on when we create an interactive site.

## App.js
Javascript file that provide the website with interacctivity. This file is responsible pf generating the navbar menu, and some interactive functions.

## Styles.css
Most of the code here was written in the first version of this project by Udacity. Only some modification were needed in this file to complete the project, and make the navbar responsive.
